# Capstone Project Documentation

## 1. Project Title
Brazilian E-commerce Data Analysis Pipeline

## 2. Project Overview
This project is a data processing and analysis pipeline using a Brazilian e-commerce dataset. It involves extracting raw CSV data files (such as orders, products, customers, and reviews), cleaning and merging them into a unified dataset, performing exploratory and statistical data analysis in Jupyter notebooks, and outputting an optimized dataset intended for future use in Tableau.

## 3. Problem Statement
E-commerce businesses track data across multiple systems, including sales, logistics, customer feedback, and payments. The goal of this project is to consolidate this fragmented data to uncover insights regarding customer behavior, delivery performance, and overall customer satisfaction.

## 4. Project Objectives
- Merge multiple relational raw data CSV files into a single master dataset.
- Clean the data by handling missing values and removing duplicates.
- Create new features such as delivery time to aid in analysis.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify business trends.
- Conduct statistical analysis and basic regression modeling to explore relationships in the data.
- Produce a clean dataset prepared for Tableau visualization.

## 5. Dataset / Data Source
- **Data Source**: Olist E-commerce dataset (Brazilian e-commerce).
- **Data Type**: Relational CSV files.
- **Important Columns**: `order_id`, `customer_id`, `product_id`, `price`, `freight_value`, `payment_value`, `review_score`, `order_purchase_timestamp`, `order_delivered_customer_date`.
- **Dataset Size**: The 9 raw CSV files contain approximately 1.6 million total rows. The final merged master dataset contains 112,651 records.
- **Limitations**: The dataset contains some missing values (e.g., missing product dimensions and unwritten review comments).

## 6. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The data cleaning process is implemented in Python scripts (`scripts/etl_pipeline.py`, `scripts/final_load_prep.py`) and Jupyter notebooks (`notebooks/02-cleaning.ipynb`). Key steps included:
- **Missing Values**: Missing text values were filled with "unknown", "no_title", or "no_comment". Numeric values like product dimensions were filled using the median.
- **Duplicate Records**: Duplicate rows were removed using the pandas `drop_duplicates()` function.
- **Inconsistent Values**: Text columns were standardized by converting to lowercase and stripping extra spaces.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Timestamp columns were converted to datetime objects. Numeric columns were optimized for memory usage (e.g., converting to `int32` or `float32`).
- **Feature Engineering**: New columns were created, such as:
  - `delivery_time_days`: The difference between the delivery date and the purchase date.
  - `is_late_delivery`: A flag indicating if the actual delivery date exceeded the estimated delivery date.
  - `sentiment`: Categorized from the `review_score`.

## 7. Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted in `notebooks/03-eda.ipynb` (executed with complete outputs) and covered:
- **Univariate Analysis**: Examined distributions of prices, freight values, review scores, and delivery times across 112,651 records.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Analyzed relationships between delivery time and customer satisfaction, payment methods and order values.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Monthly trends in order counts, total revenue (R$ 20.3M), and average order value from 2016-2018.
- **Geographic Analysis**: Top 10 states by order volume - São Paulo (SP) leads with 47,449 orders, followed by Rio de Janeiro (RJ) with 14,579 orders.
- **Product Analysis**: Identified top-performing categories - bed_bath_table (11,115 orders), health_beauty (9,670 orders), and sports_leisure (8,641 orders).
- **Customer Behavior**: Analyzed 95,420 unique customers with repeat customer rate and purchase patterns.
- **Key Insights**: Strong negative correlation (-0.305) between delivery time and review scores; credit card is the dominant payment method; average delivery time is 12 days.

## 8. Data Visualization
Visualizations were created during the EDA and statistical analysis phases using Python libraries:
- **Charts Created**: Bar charts for top product categories and geographic distributions, line charts for time series trends, and histograms for statistical distributions.
- **Tools Used**: Matplotlib and Seaborn in Jupyter Notebooks, Tableau Public for interactive dashboards.

### Tableau Dashboard

**Dashboard Title:** E-commerce Performance and Delivery Insights Dashboard

**Objective:** Analyze end-to-end e-commerce performance, focusing on revenue trends, order lifecycle, delivery efficiency, payment behavior, and customer experience.

**Key Metrics (KPIs):**
- Total Revenue
- Total Orders
- Average Delivery Time (Days)
- Delivery Success Rate (%)
- Average Order Value

**Key Visualizations:**
1. **Revenue Trend** - Time-series line chart showing revenue across purchase dates to identify growth patterns, seasonality, and demand fluctuations.
2. **Order Stage Distribution** - Categorical view of order lifecycle stages (Delivered, Shipped Not Delivered, Approved Not Shipped, Created Only) highlighting operational bottlenecks.
3. **Payment Method Distribution** - Breakdown of payment types (credit card, debit card, UPI, etc.) providing insight into customer payment preferences.
4. **Delivery Performance Analysis** - Comparison of actual vs. estimated delivery time to identify delays and logistics efficiency.
5. **Customer Experience (Reviews)** - Analysis of review scores and sentiment classification to evaluate customer satisfaction.

**Interactive Filters:**
- Order Purchase Date (Range Slider)
- Customer State (Geographical Filter)
- Order Stage (Operational Filter)

All filters are applied across the entire dashboard for consistent and dynamic analysis.

**Business Insights:**
- Delivery delays are concentrated in specific states, indicating logistical inefficiencies
- Majority of revenue is driven by delivered orders, highlighting fulfillment importance
- Credit card payments dominate, suggesting reliance on installment-based purchasing
- Negative reviews are often associated with delayed deliveries

**Design Principles:**
- Clean and minimal layout with consistent font and color usage
- Logical grouping of KPIs and charts
- Right-aligned filter panel for better usability
- High contrast for readability

## 9. Statistical Analysis / Model / Business Logic
Statistical analysis was performed in `notebooks/04-statistical_analysis.ipynb` (executed with complete outputs) using `scipy` and `scikit-learn`:

**Statistical Tests Performed:**
- **Normality Tests**: Shapiro-Wilk test on key variables (all showed non-normal distributions)
- **Hypothesis Testing**: 
  - ANOVA test for payment type vs order value (F=43.56, p<0.001) - Rejected null hypothesis
  - Pearson correlation for delivery time vs review score (r=-0.305, p<0.001) - Significant negative correlation
  - ANOVA test for state vs customer satisfaction (F=151.44, p<0.001) - Significant state differences
- **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson and Spearman correlations identified strong relationships between price and total payment value (r=0.761), freight value and product weight (r=0.610)

**Machine Learning Models:**
- **Linear Regression**: Predicted review scores using price, freight value, delivery time, and order item count
  - R² = 0.123 (explains 12.3% of variance)
  - RMSE = 1.26
  - Key finding: Delivery time has strongest negative impact (-0.423 coefficient)
  
- **Logistic Regression**: Classified high customer satisfaction (review score ≥ 4)
  - Accuracy: 78%
  - Precision: 79% for high satisfaction class
  - Key predictors: Delivery time (-0.681 log-odds), order complexity (-0.385 log-odds)

**Business Insights:**
- Delivery time is the most critical factor affecting customer satisfaction
- Payment method significantly influences order values
- Geographic location impacts both delivery performance and satisfaction levels
- Product weight correlates with shipping costs, affecting overall customer experience
